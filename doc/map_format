Map consists of two files: *.map (which fields are active and which are not) and *.meta

-- *.meta structure --
first line - coordinates of finish
each next line = one car
<x>, <y> for player-controller
<x>, <y>, <botAlgoName> for bots

-- MapCreator --
You can generate *.map file from BMP using out/mapCreator:
java -jar mapCrator-<bullshit>.jar <bmpFile>
